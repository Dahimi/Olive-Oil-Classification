# Olive-Oil-Classification
This is machine learning project where we used classification models to find the source region of olive oil based on its chemical properties.
I have embeded the project in web app using streamlit:.
You can view a demo of the app in this [link](https://share.streamlit.io/dahimi/olive-oil-classification/Programme_Principal.py)
