# Olive-Oil-Classification
This is a machine learning project where we used classification models to find the source region of olive oil based on its chemical properties. I have embedded the project in a web app using Streamlit library.
You can view a demo of the app via this [link](https://share.streamlit.io/dahimi/olive-oil-classification/Programme_Principal.py)
